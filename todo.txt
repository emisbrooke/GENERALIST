to do:

[] add Jupyter folder that contains notebooks for 
	[] running inference 
	[] running tests on generated dataset 
[] add folder to include the implementation for ardca , bmdca -- how we get the probabilities from these models.
[] Comment ALL files 
[] Work on readme to 
    [in progress] explain what the files are 
    [] 

Code 
[] save only torch or numpy files for space conservation
[check] create file that runs the inference using only hiperparameters
[check] make the Convert_fastatoNP funciton learn the sequence length on its own and remove it from compile_generalist
