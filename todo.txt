To do:

[] add Jupyter folder that contains notebooks for 
	[] running inference 
	[] running tests on generated dataset 
[] add folder to include the implementation for ardca , bmdca -- how we get the probabilities from these models.
[] Comment ALL files 
[] Work on readme to 
    [in progress] explain what the files are 
    [] 
[] add versions to requires python packages 
[] add to the readme on the repo that fasta file should have all uppercase letters with - as gaps (not . )

Code 

[] In convert fasta to np and in covert np to fasta , make the categories list an input so that it can be used over other dataset that is DNA or rNA seq data.
[] save only torch or numpy files for space conservation
[check] create file that runs the inference using only hiperparameters
[check] make the Convert_fastatoNP funciton learn the sequence length on its own and remove it from compile_generalist 
[] relabel the seqs in the msa which the true label from the OG msa. 
[] update the Generator function to use einsum instead of matmul  -- debatable
